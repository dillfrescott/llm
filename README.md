# GRU-based Language Learning Model (LLM)

An innovative approach to natural language processing using Gated Recurrent Units (GRU).

## :book: Project Description

This project aims to design and implement a language learning model using GRU networks. GRUs are a type of recurrent neural network that excels in processing sequences of data, making them ideal for tasks like language modeling. Our model leverages the power of GRUs to understand and generate human-like text.

## :rocket: Features and Highlights

- **Efficient Processing**: Utilizes the power of GRUs for efficient sequence processing.
- **Customizable**: Adjust hyperparameters to fit specific use cases.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Comes with pre-trained weights for instant usage.

## :bar_chart: Performance Metrics

*Coming soon! We are constantly testing and evaluating our model's performance.*

## :heart: Acknowledgements

* A special thanks to everyone who has contributed to this project.
