# My attempt at an LLM from scratch!

The scripts should be pretty self-explanatory, just adjust the values in the scripts to your desired values and train on any .txt file!

## Install:

1. Install `pytorch` (gpu recommended)

2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

*Note: Does it work? Yes, but it just kind of spits out random words and sentences. But hey, its an llm from scratch!*
